# Coursework-for-Advanced-Graphics-for-Games

The task was to create different graphic scenes from scratch using the OpenGL and NCLGL framework that was provided by the Newcastle University and which also has been made by us throughout the lectures and tutorials.

Some of the main features are:

Scene 1
•	real-time lighting
•	bump mapping for better light results on the heightmap
•	shadow mapping
•	cube mapping
•	skeletal animation

Scene 2
•	Cube mapping
•	Bump mapping
•	Deferred Rendering

Scene 3
•	Cube mapping
•	Environmental mapping
•	Post processing
